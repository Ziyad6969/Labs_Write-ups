# CyberTalents Labs Writeups

This folder contains **CyberTalents Labs Writeups**,

where I document and explain the publicly accessible labs I solve on [CyberTalents](https://cybertalents.com/).

This repo is meant as a **learning resource** for anyone interested in web security, ethical hacking, and penetration testing.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide clear, step-by-step explanations of lab challenges.
- Help learners understand vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
- Serve as a reference for improving practical cybersecurity skills.
- Track my own progress and learning journey over time.

> **Note:** These writeups are for **educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use these techniques on unauthorized systems. Always practice legally and responsibly.

## Structure

Each lab is organized in its own folder and contains:

- `README.md` – explains the lab objective and challenge details  
- `Solution.md` – walks through the exploitation steps and how the **FLAG** was obtained

> **Note:** It’s highly recommended to spend time attempting the lab yourself before reading the solution.  
> My personal rule is ~2 hours of effort with no progress 😅 before checking a writeup.
