Server-Side Vulnerabilities

This module covers common server-side vulnerabilities where application logic makes insecure assumptions about trusted backend behavior.

The labs in this module focus on:

    How server-side functionality can be abused through user-controlled input
    Identifying vulnerable backend requests and internal services
    Understanding real-world exploitation scenarios such as SSRF

Write-ups emphasize exploitation logic, root causes, and key takeaways rather than step-by-step walkthroughs.
